# Vex Makefile — convenience wrappers around zig build + release housekeeping.
# Most day-to-day work goes through `zig build` directly; this file exists
# so release bumps and CI checks have a single canonical entry point.

# ── Canonical version ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Single source of truth lives in build.zig.zon; build.zig propagates it
# to the binary via a build option. The Makefile reads the same field so
# `sync-docs` can rewrite human-facing prose to match a release bump.

# Docs that carry a "current example" version string that must track each
# release. Each one is rewritten by `sync-docs` and checked by `check-docs`.
# CHANGELOG-style mentions (e.g. README.md "### v0.7.1") are intentionally
# excluded — they are historical records, not current pointers.

# ── Test profiles ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Each profile is a different sanitizer / optimization mix. The chaos
# suite (below) builds the binary once at the requested optimization
# level and exercises it under load — sanitizers there catch bugs the
# unit tests can't reach because they need real concurrency.

test:
	$(ZIG) build test --summary all

# ReleaseSafe keeps Zig's bounds / overflow / null-deref panics. Close
# to ReleaseFast perf. If the production crash was a slice OOB, this is
# where it shows up cleanly (file:line panic) instead of as glibc's
# late-detection realloc abort.
test-release-safe:
	$(ZIG) build test -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe --summary all

# ThreadSanitizer instruments every load/store with happens-before
# tracking. Catches data races between Zig threads (e.g. hot-path
# read of HashMap bucket vs concurrent rehash) by reporting on the
# OFFENDING access, not the eventual corruption. ~5-10x slower; use
# for diagnosis, not steady-state CI.
test-tsan:
	$(ZIG) build test -Dsanitize-thread=true --summary all

# Line coverage via kcov (brew install kcov / apt-get install kcov).
# Report lands in coverage/index.html; src/ only. coverage/ is gitignored.

# ── Stress / chaos suite ──────────────────────────────────────────────
# A chaos script PASS means vex stayed alive under a specific load
# shape. Failure surfaces as the script printing FAIL + the relevant
# vex.log tail; logs are preserved under /tmp/vex-chaos-*.

# Cheap regressions (each ≤ ~60s). Suitable for PR-gate CI.
